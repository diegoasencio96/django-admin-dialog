In this form you indicate the url on which you want to show the modal dialog boxes and the field id.

![admin_form](https://raw.github.com/quiqueporta/django-admin-dialog/master/admin_form.png)

If you want to know the name of the form fields, you can set this setting variable:

```python
DJANGO_ADMIN_DIALOG_SHOW_IDS = True
```
Now if you access to your model form, you can see the field id's next to them.

When you access to your model admin form, you can see a new icon next to the field that you indicate previously.

And now you can click on this icon to show the dialog.
